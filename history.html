            The members of the Navigating and Direction Officers' Association
            have qualified from some of the Royal Navy's most challenging
            professional courses. Navigating and Direction Officers have been at
            the forefront of the development of naval tactics, adapting to the
            operational demands of new weapons and threats that arise from the
            latest technological innovations. The branch dates back to the late
            19th Century when Captain Henry Oliver, (seen here in the uniform of
            a Vice Admiral) established a Navigation School, initially afloat in
            HMS MERCURY and then in 1906 ashore in the Old Naval Academy in
            Portsmouth Naval Dockyard, and known as DRYAD after one of the ships
            that was used for practical training. This was the start of a long
            association between the Navigation School and ships or bases named
            DRYAD.
          </p>
          <p class="my-5">
            The Navigation School trained the navigating officers serving in the
            major warships during WW1, where new procedures and tactics were
            learnt through hard earned practical experience. Navigating officers
            advised the Fleet and Division commanders of the best methods to
            manoeuvre their formations to achieve tactical advantage over the
            enemy.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p class="my-0">
        New technology and tactics developed during WW1 were quickly introduced
        to the courses at the Navigation School during the inter war years,
        including the use of Radio Direction Finding, aerial navigation, gyro
        compasses and action plotting.
      </p>

      <div class="row flex-wrap">
        <div class="col-7">
          <p class="my-5">
            The Navigation School remained in Portsmouth Dockyard until 1941,
            when due to the increasing interruption to training from bombing of
            the naval base, it was moved to the relative safety of Southwick
            Park, just to the north of Portsdown Hill behind Portsmouth.
            Southwick Park was the home of Colonel Thistlethwayte, who had
            previously invited senior officers to shoot over his estate. After
            the Navigation School moved in and requisitioned his property, the
            invitations ceased!
          </p>
          <p class="my-5">
            The introduction of radar at sea and the very potent threat of
            aerial attack had a most profound change upon the way ships were
            fought. Prior to the advent of radar, the Captain or Admiral was
            located on the bridge of a ship from where he could see most of the
            battle and make his tactical and manoeuvring decisions. The ability
            to engage the enemy beyond the visual horizon coupled with the risk
            of ships coming under sudden air attack with little time to react
            required a radical change. Now he needed to see the locations of
            enemy aircraft and ships, obtained by radar, beyond his visual
            horizon, presented in a clear and logical format that would allow
            him to gain the tactical advantage. This was especially true for
            effective air defence.

      <p class="my-0">
        The Direction Officer specialisation developed from these changes. The
        most effective defence of ships against air attack was the use of
        fighter protection, controlled by Direction Officers viewing radar
        information in their ships, and provided the means of directing
        supporting fighters to intercept approaching enemy air raids before they
        were able to deliver their attack.

            To achieve the tactical advantage, sailors and officers were trained
            to ensure all available information was properly correlated and
            presented to enable the timely intercept of approaching air raids.
            This became known as the Action Information Organisation (AIO) and
            brought about the creation of a major branch of the Royal Navy. It
            was considered to naturally belong to the Navigation branch, as it
            was dependant upon knowing the position and movement of friendly and
            enemy ships and aircraft.
          </p>
          <p class="my-5">
            To better train the Direction Officers in the practical skills of
            interception, a Fighter Direction Training Centre (FDTC) was
            established at the Naval Air Station at Yeovilton in 1941.
            Operational activities at Yeovilton forced the FDTC shortly
            afterwards to move to nearby Speckington Hall. Due to the shortage
            of both radar and aircraft with which to practise, a heavy reliance
            was placed upon teaching the principles, and included the use of
            Walls ice cream tricycles, one being an "enemy aircraft" and another
            being a "friendly fighter". The Direction Officer could see both
            "aircraft" and would pass the necessary directions for the "fighter"
            to close and intercept the "enemy".
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p class="my-0">
        As greater operational experience was gained, the need for separate Air
        Direction Rooms (ADRs) with dedicated communications and plotting
        equipment became increasingly apparent. To ensure the most effective
        compartment layouts and presentational methods, mock up "models" of ADRs
        in various classes of ships were built in the outbuildings of Southwick
        House and named the Action Information Training Centre (AITC), with many
        of the staff coming from the navigation branch. Southwick Park became
        known as HMS DRYAD, and was also the HQ for Operation OVERLORD, the
        invasion of Normandy.

          <p class="my-5">
            Just as WW2 was ending, a purpose built RN Air Direction Centre was
            built at Kete on St Anne's Head in Pembrokeshire, where the radar
            systems had an uninterrupted view over the adjacent waters of the
            Irish Sea, and was later named HMS HARRIER. The reorganisation and
            reduction in size of the Royal Navy following WW2 resulted in Kete
            closing in 1960 and the training of Direction Officers returning to
            Yeovilton and DRYAD.
          </p>
          <p class="my-5">
            From 1945 to 2004 HMS DRYAD established itself as the Royal Navy's
            leading maritime warfare training centre, known as the School of
            Maritime Operations (SMOPS) and later the Maritime Warfare School
            (MWS), requiring a major building programme and the development of
            the most up to date and sophisticated shore based training
            facilities.

        Many of the people and ships linked with the development of the N and D
        specialisations were represented in the names of several buildings
        including Captain (later Admiral) Oliver, founder of the Navigation
        School. The development at DRYAD required so much space that for the
        period between 1975 and 1993 the Navigation School was moved to HMS
        MERCURY on the top of the South Downs near Petersfield in Hampshire,
        where a view of the Solent could be had on a clear day.
      </p>
      <p class="my-5">
        Further consolidation of the Royal Navy's training centres resulted in
        the closure of HMS DRYAD in 2004 and the relocation of most of its
        training to HMS COLLINGWOOD near Fareham, where the Navigation School is
        now based in Endeavour Building. Fighter Controllers, the modern day
        successors to the Direction Officer, continue to be trained at
        Yeovilton, and COLLINGWOOD.
